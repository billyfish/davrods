# davrods-vhost.conf
#
# davrods is a mod_dav WebDAV provider. Configuration directives for davrods
# should be placed in a <Location> block.
#
# Below we provide an example vhost configuration that enables davrods using
# its default options.
#
#<VirtualHost *:80>
#
#    # Enter your server name here.
#    ServerName www.example.com
#
#    # NB: Some webdav clients expect the server to implement webdav at the root
#    # location (they execute an OPTIONS request to verify existence of webdav
#    # protocol support).
